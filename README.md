Visit [rishabh14.now.sh](https://rishabh14.now.sh/) for my portfolio.

I'm Rishabh Varshney and currently in my third year of bachelor's degree in Computer Science. This portfolio is compilation of the 
projects, Research Papers that I have implemented and Notebooks in which I have done EDA.

## Projects

### Chemical Formula to Chemical Name prediction

Trained an attention-based Encoder-Decoder model on Chemical to Name Dataset scraped from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chemical_formulae) to predict the chemical name of any (real or not) chemical formula given to it. Used Streamlit to create a web app for easy interaction with the model. 
Check the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Formula-to-Name) and Live app [here](https://formula-to-name.herokuapp.com/).

### OpenImages.jl

Created a Julia package for easy downloading and creating dataset from [Google's OpenImages](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) for any project.
Check the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/OpenImages.jl).

### PM Narendra Modi Speech Analysis

Scrape data from the PM Narendra Modi's official [website](https://rishabhvarshney14.github.io/pm-modi-speech-analysis/) and used it to do analysis. You can check the analysis [here](https://rishabhvarshney14.github.io/pm-modi-speech-analysis/). Data scraped can be found on my github repo [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/pm-modi-speech-analysis).

### Detect House Item

In this project I use Google's Open Images Dataset to train Retinanet (backend by resnet) to tell what items are present in the image. i use [keras-retinanet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) model for this project. You can check the code [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Detect-House-Item)
and the live app [here](https://detecthouseitem.herokuapp.com/)

### Digit Sequence Recognition

In this project I use MNIST handwritten dataset to generate a sequence of 5 digits and trained it on a model that I created with keras.
You can check the code [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Digit_sequence_recognition/blob/master/Digit_Sequence_Recognition.ipynb)

### AUSPL: Another useless Programming Language
Created a programming language based on the Monkey Lang. It has basic data types like integer and string along with functions and if-else. Consists of additional functionality like while loops apart from Monkey Lang.  You can check the code [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/AUSPL).

### Sorting Visualization

In this project I used various sorting algorithms and visualise them using matplotlib. Sorting algorithms that I use are Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort. You can check the code [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Sorting-Visualization).

### Covid 19 Webapp

Used ReactJS to create a webapp for Covid-19. Display current number of deaths, infected and recovered globaly or by countries. Used Netlify for hosting the web application.
You can check the code [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/covid19-webapp) or the live version [here](https://covid19webapp.netlify.app/)

## Kaggle

### Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+

I use this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney) from Kaggle and did some data analysis and visualisation on it. You can check the notebook [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Kaggle-Datasets/blob/master/Stremaing%20Platform%20EDA.ipynb)
