# Rishabh Varshney

I'm Rishabh Varshney and currently in my second year of bachelor's degree in Computer Science. This portfolio is compilation of the 
projects, Research Papers that I have implemented and Notebooks in which I have done EDA.

## Projects

### Digit Sequence Recognition

In this project I use MNIST handwritten dataset to generate a sequence of 5 digits and trained it on a model that I created with keras.
You can check the code [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Digit_sequence_recognition/blob/master/Digit_Sequence_Recognition.ipynb)

### Sorting Visualization

In this project I used various sorting algorithms and visualise them using matplotlib. Sorting algorithms that I use are Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort. You can check the code [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Sorting-Visualization)

## Implementation of Models

- [AlexNet](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Implementation-of-Research-Papers/tree/master/AlexNet)
- [ZFNet](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Implementation-of-Research-Papers/tree/master/ZFNet)
- [VGG16](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Implementation-of-Research-Papers/tree/master/VGG16)
- [ResNet50](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Implementation-of-Research-Papers/tree/master/ResNet50)

## Kaggle

### Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+

I use this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney) from Kaggle and did some data analysis and visualisation on it. You can check the notebook [here](https://github.com/rishabhvarshney14/Kaggle-Datasets/blob/master/Stremaing%20Platform%20EDA.ipynb)
